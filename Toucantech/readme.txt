This is coding test for the company toucantech I took which part of there job application process.
Here are the instructions for the code test:

The ToucanTech database stores information about its members. Each member can be associated with 1 or more school. 
You should build a demo that allows someone to add a new member with the fields “Name”, “Email Address” and "School"
(selected from a list). The demo should display all members for a selected school.
